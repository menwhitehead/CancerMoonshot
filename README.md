# CancerMoonshot

This repository contains supporting code for our USPTO Cancer Moonshot Challenge entry.

Visualization code is in the Javascript (js) directory.  This code just loads the pre-generated t-SNE clustering images and adds interactivity.

The backend code performs the clusterings and generates the corresponding images.
